## Todo App

ProtoCraft is in its initial development phase, driven by the vision to redefine design collaboration. We encourage users to explore and provide feedback, especially if any bugs are encountered during use. Your insights will help enhance the stability and functionality of ProtoCraft.

The development of ProtoCraft was inspired by the JSMastery YouTube tutorial, leveraging Liveblocks to bring real-time synchronization to life. Dive into collaborative design with ProtoCraft and, if you encounter any issues, share your feedback to contribute to the ongoing improvement of this project.
